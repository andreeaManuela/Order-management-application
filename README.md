This application simulates customer orders to a warehouse. 
The program contains three tables: Customer, Product, and Order. 
The application will connect to a database where information related to customers, products, and orders will be stored.
A graphical interface will be used to add, modify, delete, and validate orders. When the validation button is pressed, a PDF file representing the 'receipt' for the respective order will be generated, and the product stock will be updated.
